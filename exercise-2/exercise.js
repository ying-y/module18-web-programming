//Use a D3 selector to select the element with an id of `circleA`
//Use JavaScript to give this element a `fill` attribute of '#5f5f5f'


//Give the element with an id of `circleB` the following attributes:
//  cx:375, cy:130, fill:'#5f5f5f'
//Use method chaining!


//Give all <path> elements a `stroke` attribute of `#5f5f5f` and
//a `stroke-width` of `8` (pixels)


//Give all <circle> elements in the <g> with id of `group1` a fill color of 'white'
//Hint: first select the group, then select the circles _inside_ that group.


//Give all of the <circle> elements inside the `<g>` inside of `group1`
//a fill color of '#573d29'


//Give the element with id `circleC` a style opacity of `1`


//Add a new <circle> element to the <svg> image with the following attributes:
//  cx:300, cy:210, r:50


//Remove ALL of the <rect> elements from the <svg> image.


//Use the `raise()` method to move the element with id `pathA` to become the
//last child of its parent (and so be "on top").
//Also change it's `stroke` attribute to be `'none'` (removing the stroke).
